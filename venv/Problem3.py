# PROBLEM 3 ANSWERS:
# Casino owner:
# For a casino owner playing the game 1,000 times, the average expected reward for the casino owner is: 25.9
# For the casino owner, the 95% CI of the casino's average expected reward is: [20.007023505241968, 31.79297649475803]

# If this simulation was repeated many times in order to construct a number of
# independent 95% confidence intervals each based on 1000 observations,
# the proportion of these confidence intervals that will cover the
# average expected reward of the casino owner is expected to be 95%.


# Gambler:
# For a gambler playing the game 10 times, the average expected reward is: -70.0
# For the gambler, the 95% PI of average expected reward is: [-227.5, 50.0]

# Since there are so few observations (times the gambler is playing the game),
# the law of large numbers cannot be applied to make an inference about E[X].
# Therefore, this is a transient-state simulation model and
# the projection interval must be reported.
# If this simulation was repeated many times in order to construct a number of
# independent 95% projection intervals each based on n observations,
# the proportion of these intervals that will cover the
# gamblers's average expected reward is expected to be 95%.

# PROBLEM 2 - How do you interpret the confidence intervals
# you reported in Problem 1?

# EXPECTED REWARD:
# If this trial was repeated many times in order to construct a number of
# independent 95% confidence intervals each based on n observations,
# the proportion of these confidence intervals that will cover the
# average expected reward is expected to be 95%.


# PROBABILITY OF LOSS:
# If this trial was repeated many times in order to construct a number of
# independent 95% confidence intervals each based on n observations,
# the proportion of these confidence intervals that will cover the
# average probability of loss is expected to be 95%.
